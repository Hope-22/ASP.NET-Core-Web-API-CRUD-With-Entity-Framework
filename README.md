# ASP.NET-Core-Web-API-CRUD-With-Entity-Framework
ASP.NET Core API that performs CRUD operations in an SQL Server database. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete.
Used REST patterns while building the .NET API. First installed Entity Framework Core In-Memory Database and 
used this database to perform CRUD operations while building the ASP.NET Web API.
Then changed the implementation to use a SQL Server database and use Entity Framework Core (EF Core)
to perform the CRUD operations in the ASP.NET Core API.
